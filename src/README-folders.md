# Folders

In the RFC for Server Components there are three component types specified, `server`, `client` and `shared`.
And while they have to differ per file name (`.client.js`, `.server.js`, `.js`).

As I tend to overlook the file suffixes, I also put them in different folders to get a better overview.
